* What is ejs?
What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

* Difference between <%= %> and <% %>
<%= %> -- will display
<% %>  -- will not display

* res.render(fileName, object)
fileName is the file you want to render
object allows you to pass through a local variable to template variable

* How to style ejs?

1. Add style tag just like in htmls
