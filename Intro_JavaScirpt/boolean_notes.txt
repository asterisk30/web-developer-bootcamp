Booleans are true or false in Javascript, it is a way of helping us make decisions

comparison in JS could be the following
  1. ==/ != equal to/ not equal to
    - 1 == 2 -> false
    - 2 == 2 -> true
* Below is due to type coercion *
    - 1 == "1" -> true
    - true == 1 -> true
    - false == 0 -> false
    - null == undefined -> true
* Below is a case need to be aware of *
    - NaN == NaN -> false

  2. >/< larger than/ less than
  3. >=/<= larger equal to/ less equal to
 
 * Below is due to NO type coercion *
    - 1 === "1" -> false, type of 1 and "1" are different
    - [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] -> false, even if they are the same value and type, they are NON PRIMITIVE variables which means they cannot be compared this way
